A useful collection of Divi Modules and extensions.

== Description ==

The Battle Suit for Divi by Divi Sensei is a collection of useful Divi modules, extension and overall improvements for the Divi Builder and the Divi Theme by Elegant Themes.

=== Divi modules ===

This version contains the following modules:

* Another Post: display the content of another post. The post can be any post type, even custom ones
* Bucket: a blurb like module with hover effects, perfect for creating bucket lists or present products
* Footer: display the Divi footer. Perfect if you want the default footer on a blank page template or in combination with layout injection plugins like Toolset
* Library Layout: inject any layout from the Divi library 
* Masonry Gallery: a gallery alternative to the boring old Divi grid. Display images of various sizes in a nice, responsive masonry style
* Post Button: a button to link to a post
* Post Excerpt: a powerful module to display and customise the post excerpt 
* Post Featured Image: display your featured image with all the advantages and settings of the Image module
* Post Meta: a highly customisable module to display post meta information the way you want it
* Post Title: a simple post title module 
* Transformable Image: a 3D image with hover effects 
* Video Lightbox: a module to open videos in a lightbox, perfect to replicate the Elegant Themes Blog 

Our Post related modules are fully compatible with "The Loop" so you can use plugins like Toolset to completly customize your archive or search pages without coding, using shortcodes or customise your CSS.

=== Divi extensions ===

With our extensions, Divi becomes more accessible and easier to use:

* "Edit in Visual Builder" link: this extensions adds a "Edit in Visual Builder" link in the post list page for every post, page and custom post type that uses the Visual Builder
* Responsive Preview: this extension adds additional responsive breakpoints to the Visual Builder mobile preview. Now you can check out how your site would look on XS, S, M, L and XL phones as well as S, M and L tablets
* Permanent Theme Options Help: many people don't even know that Divis Theme Options settings have a help text. Now you can permanently display the help text in the Theme Options
* Permanent VB Help: permanently display the help text for settings fields in the Visual Builder. This extension is perfect if you are a beginner
* Permanent VB Icons: permanently display the icons like help and hover settings next to a settings field label in the Visual Builder

=== WordPress Widgets ===

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the Post modules for? =
The Post related modules in Battle Suit for Divi have two purposes. The first one is to build custom post layouts and be completely free and not limited by Divis core modules, which have a similar functionality as ours but are often not so powerful.
The second purpose is that our modules can be used inside [The Loop](https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop) to build completely customized archives. A great plugin which works perfectly together with Battle Suit for Divi is [Toolset](https://divi-sensei.com/toolset). Together with our Toolset Add-On, your imagination becomes the only limit for building layouts and utilising custom post fields.

= Is Battle Suit for Divi really free? =
Yes, Battle Suit for Divi is completely free and there is no hidden fee or premium code inside. We will also continue to add more modules and functionality and never charge you a single cent for it.
There are paid add-ons though, which have a very specialised purpose. For example, we have a add-on which adds [Toolset](https://divi-sensei.com/toolset) related modules and we are working on other add-ons as well. 
Nevertheless, there is no need for those add-ons and you can absolutely use all the great features from the free base plugin without ever spending a dime. If you wish to support us, we would highly appreciate it if you could leave a positive review. 

= I have a problem, what shall I do? =
Ideally you would not leave a negative review but contact us directly. Worpress.org currently can't notify us and we could miss your issue. If you contact us directly, for example via the contact form on our homepage, we can help you faster.
